Forecasting with Machine Learning Uplimit course work

## Installation
I used poetry to manage the dependencies.

## Assignment 1
The first assignment is to forecast the number of sales given a dataset of sales data.
A lot of pandas manipulation is done to get the data in the right format.

I wouldn't normally commit an ipynb with this many plots to version control, but as having the plots visible will 
make it 100x easier for the reviewers, I've committed them.
